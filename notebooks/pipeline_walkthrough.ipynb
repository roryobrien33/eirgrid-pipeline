    "\n",
    "Each day, the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trains a forecasting model on a fixed historical window (e.g. the previous 60 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generates a forecast for the next complete day only (96 × 15-minute intervals)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Stores the forecast alongside the training window length and model identifier\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mirrors how forecasting is handled in real operational environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forecasts are always made without access to future actuals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models are re-trained regularly to adapt to seasonality, drift, and structural changes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each forecast represents the information available at that point in time\n",
    "\n",
    "Prophet is used as the primary forecasting model due to its:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strong performance on seasonal time-series\n",
    "\n",
    "- Native support for daily and weekly patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- Robustness to missing data and irregularities\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure reliability, a deterministic fallback model is implemented. If Prophet fails to converge or errors during fitting, the system falls back to a slot-median baseline, producing a valid next-day forecast without interrupting the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "All forecast outputs are constrained to physical reality:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Negative values are clipped to 0 MW\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upper and lower confidence bounds are preserved where available\n",

    "\n",
    "- Visualise actual system demand vs next-day forecast demand at 15-minute resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantify forecast accuracy using standard error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)\n",

    "- Dashboard refreshes are user-initiated, while the data pipeline remains fully automated\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation notes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each forecast curve represents a next-day prediction generated using only historical data available prior to the forecast date\n",

    "\n",
    "- Forecast values are clipped at zero to respect physical constraints of electricity demand\n",

    "# 7. Summary\n",
    "This project demonstrates a complete, end-to-end data engineering and forecasting workflow built with production principles in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "From raw API ingestion to analytics-ready outputs, the system shows how time-series energy data can be reliably collected, validated, transformed, forecasted, and evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key competencies illustrated include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Designing a robust ingestion pipeline with retry logic, validation, and defensive parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling time-zones and daylight-saving transitions correctly for operational data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implementing staging and canonical layers to ensure data quality and idempotency\n",
    "\n",
    "- Building a repeatable daily workflow suitable for scheduling and automation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training rolling, non-leaky forecasts that reflect real operational constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "- Persisting forecasts in a form suitable for downstream analytics and BI tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluating model performance using standard forecasting error metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture deliberately separates concerns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python handles ingestion, transformation, forecasting, and export\n",
    "\n",
    "- SQLite provides a lightweight, inspectable warehouse for development\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parquet acts as a stable interchange format for analytics tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- Power BI focuses solely on visualization and interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation keeps the system modular, debuggable, and easy to extend. While the current implementation uses Prophet and SQLite, the same design patterns apply directly to larger-scale systems using PostgreSQL, cloud object storage, or orchestration frameworks such as Airflow or Prefect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the project is intended to reflect how real-world data pipelines are built, tested, and evaluated — not just how models are trained, but how they are operationalized and assessed over time."
